# Tribute_Page_Julija777


I've decided not to overthink on the Tribute page topic so I've created a tribute page about myself. 
Because it’s quicker to get information and no need to ask for rights to publicise someone's photos. 
I was excited when I managed to link my photos directly from social media to the tribute page. 
I fould it's a cool way of creating visuals as no need for storage on a local PC and no extra downloads!


The task from SoC:

- [ ] We’d like you to complete the first project in FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certification, 
the tribute page. You can make your tribute page about anything you want. Let your personality shine through!

- [ ] Your page needs to fulfill all of the user stories listed on FreeCodeCamp’s requirements page. 
You can create a Codepen using their template and run their inbuilt test suite to check how you’re doing, 
and then feel free to submit it to FreeCodeCamp to get your first step toward their certification. 
This will be great practice in building a project according to a set of requirements as user stories, just like software developers do in the tech industry.

- [ ] However, we’d also like you to solidify the other knowledge you’ve gained in the activities above. 
Codepen is a great way to get started coding in the browser, but we’d like you to take it to the next level and get used to working 
with Git and in Github repositories. 
- [ ] We use GitHub Classroom for our assignments during the course, 
so to give you your first taste of that, please click on the classroom link here and accept a new assignment. 
This will create your own personal repository that you can then clone down.

- [ ] In this repository, please:
    * Take your code from the Codepen challenge and insert it into the HTML and CSS files within the repository.
* Use your new Markdown skills to write a README for the repository. 
In it, you can talk about why you chose the subject you chose for your tribute page as well as what you learned making 
it and any reflections on the development journey.
* Add, commit, and push your changes to that repository using your new Git skills on the command line in the VS Code terminal.
* Host the website using GitHub pages.


P.S. Link to the original code when I've started to code is:

Then it was modified by me in VSCode and then a bit straight in the GitHub.
